    "paragraphs": [
      "We need to advance integrative practices and reflections aimed at enabling a more effective confrontation of inequalities, social injustices, and complex environmental challenges in a critical and responsible way. We have long witnessed the negative effects of the predominance of a prevailing view of modernity that fragments, isolates and disconnects parts of a whole, whether at an individual, social or environmental level.",
      "We see this in ideas and creations focused on temporary solutions or particular interests, in actions and decisions that ignore the deep connections between elements, beings and biomes in all their diversity, in stories told by a single voice, disconnected from many others that intricately shape the same moment and temporal reality, in isolated theories and models rigidly bound to their own certainties, and in so many other phenomena that reinforce this logic of fragmentation.",
      "Faced with this scenario, we have two choices: to accept and reproduce these structures, or to seek ruptures, new perspectives and changes that promote greater awareness, integration, justice, and equity. We need more systemic agents of transformation that act with maturity and that are committed to generating positive impacts. To this end, we need models (and anti-models) that expand our repertoire of action.",
      "This material reiterates our intention, which is to continue contributing to the field of social and environmental impact, supporting organizations and people within the ecosystem! Therefore, we would like to invite you to explore Model C, to reflect, build and commit to a more integrated and systemic approach that recognizes the complexity and interdependence between impact and business, people, and territories, present and future. May Model C be a living instrument, capable of inspiring new questions, strengthening pathways, and driving transformations that truly matter for the world we seek to build."
